the stored prosedeuer delete_employee takes an int that is the ID of an employee and delletes them.
yes i am aware that this dose not work i have yet to set it to cascade on dellete, COMMING SOON^TM.

im also aware that the primary key called department_ID is redundant right now i will fix this at some point to.

the view employeess is for seeing the employee ID with the full title.

SEE relation diagram to understan how the DB is setup.
